            I graduated with a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering from
            NTUT, and I'm serving in the army now. The reason why I apply for
            this position is that I'm interested in front-end engineering,
            especially the layout and animation effects. I was once in an
            independent study project that needed to show the data using
            website. After referring to many online resources, somehow I was
            fascinated by its infinite possibility. I even volunteered to take
            over the job. Although the result was not very good due to lack of
            time, I came up an idea of going into front-end field. By having
            learned every day and created side projects since about four months
            before graduation, I hope to exchange views with more people
            passionate about web development, and additionally, sharpen my
            skills.

本人畢業於臺北科技大學機械工程系，目前正在服役中。之所以應徵此職位是因為有次學校的專題需要用網頁來呈現，在研究之後感覺很有興趣，
          尤其是網頁外觀的呈現以及動畫效果，我甚至因此自告奮勇接下這個工作，雖然當時做出來不怎麼樣，
          卻在過程中產生了投入前端工作的想法。因此在畢業前5個月開始買了課程自學前端語言，每天學習，並且作了一些project，
          希望可以和更多熱愛網站開發的人一起交流，並讓自己的前端經驗更加豐富。
